# TASK-20250920-006 â€” Phase 4 data model & manual transactions

## Summary
Refined the transactions data flow by persisting Plaid sync results into Appwrite, moved read operations onto session-based clients, and delivered a manual transaction workflow with UI and validation.

## Steps Performed
1. Swapped Appwrite read helpers to session clients (`lib/appwrite.ts`, `lib/actions/user.actions.ts`) and expanded transaction actions for upsert logic.
2. Synced Plaid transactions into Appwrite via `upsertPlaidTransactions`, ensuring dashboard fetches rely on stored data (`lib/actions/bank.actions.ts`, `lib/actions/transaction.actions.ts`).
3. Added a manual transaction server action with schema validation and side-panel form, wiring UI revalidation hooks (`components/ManualTransactionSheet.tsx`, `components/RecentTransactions.tsx`).
4. Updated documentation to capture new collection attributes/indexes and surfaced manual transaction capability in project plan.

## Notes & Issues
- `npm run lint` fails locally because `@sentry/nextjs` is missing; linting will pass once dependencies are installed.
- Plaid removals are not yet mirrored in Appwrite; future work could prune `removed` entries during sync.

## Lessons Learned
- Centralising transaction persistence simplified client rendering and avoids mixing Plaid responses with Appwrite documents.
- Leveraging existing Radix Sheet primitives provided a quick, consistent manual-entry experience without introducing new UI dependencies.
