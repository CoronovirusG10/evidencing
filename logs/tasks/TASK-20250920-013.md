# TASK-20250920-013 â€” Phase 11 Azure deployment enablement

## Summary
Created UAE-focused deployment guidance covering Azure provisioning, CI/CD, secret management, and post-deploy verification steps.

## Steps Performed
1. Authored `docs/azure-deployment.md` with Resource Group/App Service/Key Vault CLI commands targeted at UAE North.
2. Added GitHub Actions example for build/deploy pipeline and Key Vault secret integration notes.
3. Linked documentation from README and manual test plan for end-to-end verification.

## Notes & Issues
- Publish profile deployment is used in the example; consider swapping to federated identity (OIDC) for production hardening.

## Lessons Learned
- Consolidating deployment, secrets, and verification steps in one doc simplifies onboarding for future operators.
