# TASK-20250920-012 â€” Phase 10 documentation & change log

## Summary
Expanded project documentation covering setup, testing, change logging, and manual validation steps so future releases can follow a consistent process.

## Steps Performed
1. Updated README with tooling references, feature flag guidance, and links to theming/ test plan docs.
2. Authored `docs/manual-test-plan.md` and `docs/CHANGELOG.md` with initial entries and a PR checklist.
3. Added `docs/tooling.md` references to the README and ensured tests/lint scripts are reflected in documentation.

## Notes & Issues
- Change log currently tracks the initial wave of tasks; ensure future PRs append entries with task IDs.

## Lessons Learned
- Centralizing documentation under `docs/` makes it easier to expose curated guidance in README without overwhelming it.
