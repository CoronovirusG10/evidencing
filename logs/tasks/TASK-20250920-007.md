# TASK-20250920-007 â€” Statements and export workflows

## Summary
Delivered CSV and PDF export capabilities with filter-aware routes, introduced a dedicated statements dashboard, and refreshed the transaction history experience with contextual filtering.

## Steps Performed
1. Implemented filter utilities, CSV serializer, and lightweight PDF builder (`lib/transactions`, `lib/pdf.ts`) powering the new export endpoints.
2. Created `/api/transactions/export` and `/api/statements/pdf` routes with ownership checks, filter handling, and download-friendly responses.
3. Added statement/transaction filter components and manual-entry integration across history and statements pages.
4. Built the statements page with running totals, preview summary, and download actions; updated navigation and documentation accordingly.

## Notes & Issues
- `npm run lint` still fails without the optional `@sentry/nextjs` dependency; install before running lint locally.
- Statement PDF generation uses a minimal custom renderer; branding/layout refinements can be layered atop the current output if richer PDFs are required.

## Lessons Learned
- Centralising transaction filtering and serialization simplified cross-surface reuse for CSV/PDF exports.
- Keeping exports behind Appwrite ownership checks helps maintain parity between UI filters and downloadable datasets.
