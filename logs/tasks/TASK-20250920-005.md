# TASK-20250920-005 â€” Access control hardening

## Summary
Implemented the `ALLOWED_EMAILS` allowlist across sign-in/sign-up flows, added a reusable auth guard plus middleware enforcement, and surfaced helpful error messaging when disallowed users attempt to authenticate.

## Steps Performed
1. Introduced `lib/auth.ts`/`lib/auth-guard.ts` utilities for parsing the allowlist, verifying users, and reusing the guard in layout middleware.
2. Added `middleware.ts` to block protected routes and API calls when the allowlist is active, tying enforcement to a secure cookie set during authentication.
3. Updated `signIn`/`signUp` server actions to enforce the allowlist, align cookie handling, and return structured success/error responses consumed by `AuthForm`.
4. Enhanced `AuthForm` to surface authorization errors to end-users and kept logs/docs (`docs/appwrite-cloud-setup.md`, README) in sync with the new `ALLOWED_EMAILS` variable.

## Notes & Issues
- Middleware falls back to allowing all traffic when `ALLOWED_EMAILS` is unset, preserving local/dev flexibility.
- Session cookies remain valid even when an email becomes unauthorized; middleware redirect ensures no protected content is exposed but future revocation tooling could automate session cleanup.

## Lessons Learned
- Returning structured results from server actions simplifies client-side UX updates when additional validation is introduced.
