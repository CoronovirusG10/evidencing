# TASK-20250920-008 — Phase 6 theming & legal surfaces

## Summary
Refreshed Horizon’s UI to match a private banking visual language, introduced regulatory disclosures, and documented the rebranding process for future deployments.

## Steps Performed
1. Expanded Tailwind brand tokens and updated global surfaces/components to use the new gradient palette (`tailwind.config.ts`, `app/globals.css`, `app/layout.tsx`).
2. Enhanced transaction visuals with direction badges and navigation updates (`components/TransactionsTable.tsx`, `constants/index.ts`, `components/TransactionFilters.tsx`).
3. Added a reusable legal disclaimer banner, dashboard integrations, and a dedicated `/legal/disclaimer` route.
4. Authored `docs/theming-guide.md` detailing how to adjust colors, typography, and legal content for new brands/regions.

## Notes & Issues
- Transaction direction badges currently rely on the inferred amount sign when `transaction.direction` is missing; future data migrations should normalize legacy records.
- Legal copy references UAE deployment compliance; update wording for other jurisdictions as needed.

## Lessons Learned
- Centralizing palette tokens in Tailwind simplified re-skinning multiple surfaces simultaneously.
- Reusable legal components keep disclosures consistent across dashboards and export experiences.
