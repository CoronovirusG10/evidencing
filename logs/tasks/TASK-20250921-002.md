# TASK-20250921-002 â€” Redeploy Under `/internet-banking`

## Purpose
Rollback the root-level deployment, ensure the Next.js app is packaged under an `internet-banking/` subdirectory, and redeploy so the Azure App Service serves content only from that sub-path.

## Summary
- Updated `scripts/create-azure-zip.sh` to stage build artifacts inside `internet-banking/` and keep `startup.sh` at the archive root.
- Adjusted `startup.sh` to launch the server from `/home/site/wwwroot/internet-banking`.
- Rebuilt `horizon-internet-banking.zip`, redeployed with `./deploy-to-azure.sh`, and confirmed `/internet-banking/sign-in` resolves while `/` no longer serves the app.
- Refreshed deployment documentation (`README.md`, `DEPLOY_INSTRUCTIONS.md`) to describe the subdirectory packaging model.

## Commands Executed
- `scripts/create-azure-zip.sh`
- `./deploy-to-azure.sh`
- `curl -IL https://horizon-banking-uae.azurewebsites.net/internet-banking/`

## Follow-ups
- Run the manual test plan against the live `/internet-banking/` path.
- Restore any required root content (landing page or placeholder) if stakeholders expect non-404 responses at `/`.

## Lessons Learned
Packaging the app beneath a dedicated subdirectory keeps the Web App flexible for hosting other experiences and avoids confusing base-path routing after deployment.
