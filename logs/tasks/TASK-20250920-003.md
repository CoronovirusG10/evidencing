# TASK-20250920-003 â€” Phase 1 discovery & environment baseline

## Summary
Completed the discovery sweep by auditing the current Horizon codebase, cataloguing environment dependencies, and mapping gaps between the existing build and the private banking portal requirements.

## Steps Performed
1. Reviewed repository structure, key Next.js routes, and Plaid/Dwolla integration points (`package.json`, `lib/actions/*.ts`, `app/(root)`).
2. Enumerated required environment variables and runtime expectations from server actions and SDK clients (`lib/appwrite.ts`, `lib/plaid.ts`, `lib/actions/*`).
3. Compared present functionality to deliverables, noting missing manual transaction tooling, export endpoints, access controls, feature flags, and security/documentation commitments.
4. Updated `PROJECT_PLAN.md` Phase 1 checkboxes and prepared findings for stakeholder communication.

## Notes & Issues
- README env template references `APPWRITE_SECRET`/`PLAID_ENV`, but runtime code expects `NEXT_APPWRITE_KEY` and hard-codes the Plaid sandbox; needs reconciliation.
- No middleware guard or allowlist support exists yet; current redirect only checks for any Appwrite session.

## Lessons Learned
- Centralizing environment variable documentation early will simplify upcoming Azure deployment guidance.
