# TASK-20250921-001 â€” Azure App Service Deployment

## Purpose
Package the Horizon banking portal with the `/internet-banking/` base path and push the artifact to the production App Service (`horizon-banking-uae`).

## Summary
- Regenerated the standalone build using `scripts/create-azure-zip.sh`, producing `horizon-internet-banking.zip`.
- Executed `./deploy-to-azure.sh` to update the Web App runtime (NODE|20-lts), confirm the startup script, and publish the zip to Azure.
- Followed up with `az webapp config appsettings list` to verify Key Vault reference settings after the deployment command timed out post-success message.

## Commands Executed
- `scripts/create-azure-zip.sh`
- `./deploy-to-azure.sh`
- `az webapp config appsettings list --resource-group horizon-rg-uae --name horizon-banking-uae --query "[?contains(@.value,'@Microsoft.KeyVault')].[name,value]" -o table`

## Follow-ups
- Run manual verification steps described in `docs/manual-test-plan.md` on the live environment.
- Monitor Azure deployment logs and Application Insights for any runtime anomalies.

## Lessons Learned
- The deployment script may exceed CLI timeout when listing app settings; running the verification command separately avoids rerunning the entire script.
