# TASK-20250920-014 — Azure Deployment Alignment

## Purpose
Update deployment tooling, documentation, and logs to reflect the production App Service (`horizon-banking-uae`), ensure `/internet-banking/` base path packaging, and provide a repeatable zip deployment workflow.

## Summary
- Added `startup.sh` and `scripts/create-azure-zip.sh` to produce the standalone App Service package with `.next/standalone`, `.next/static`, `public/`, and package metadata.
- Refreshed `deploy-to-azure.sh` to target `horizon-banking-uae`, set `NODE|20-lts`, assign the managed identity, and verify Key Vault-backed app settings.
- Normalized scripts, guides, and checklists (`README.md`, `docs/azure-deployment.md`, `DEPLOY_INSTRUCTIONS.md`, `integration-guide.md`, `DEPLOYMENT_READY.md`, `azure.config.json`) to use the live resource names and updated deployment flow.
- Extended manual/operational docs with base-path validation, startup command checks, and redeploy guidance.
- Logged updates in project plan collateral (`logs/daily/2025-09-20.md`, `AGENTS.md`).

## Commands Executed
- `scripts/create-azure-zip.sh` (new script, documented usage)
- `./deploy-to-azure.sh` (updated script — dry-run review only)

## Follow-ups
- Ensure CI/CD pipeline mirrors `scripts/create-azure-zip.sh` steps before invoking `az webapp deploy`.
- Re-run end-to-end manual validation post next deployment and capture results in daily log.

## Lessons Learned
Aligning on the live App Service name prevents confusion during log reviews and deployment troubleshooting; packaging the standalone build keeps Kudu deployment deterministic.
