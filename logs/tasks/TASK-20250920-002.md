# TASK-20250920-002 â€” Implement daily/task logging framework

## Summary
Created `logs/daily` and `logs/tasks` directories, established daily log template, and documented linkage requirements between daily summaries and task details.

## Steps Performed
1. Added folder structure under `logs/` for daily and per-task records.
2. Authored daily log entry for 2025-09-20 referencing completed tasks.
3. Updated `AGENTS.md` with guidance on maintaining both daily and task-level logs.

## Notes & Issues
- Same benign Homebrew shellenv warning observed when running shell commands.

## Lessons Learned
- Keeping a consistent task ID format (`TASK-YYYYMMDD-###`) will simplify cross-referencing between logs and project plan items.
