# TASK-20250920-004 â€” Appwrite Cloud configuration guide

## Summary
Documented the Appwrite Cloud setup required for Horizon, covering project provisioning, database/collection schemas, index requirements, environment variable mapping, and how the codebase consumes Appwrite clients.

## Steps Performed
1. Audited `lib/appwrite.ts` and related server actions to confirm required scopes and session usage.
2. Defined database collections (`users`, `banks`, `transactions`) with attributes and indexes that align with existing queries.
3. Authored `docs/appwrite-cloud-setup.md`, including API key scope guidance and environment variable mapping.

## Notes & Issues
- Current implementation stores plaintext passwords in the `users` collection; future hardening should hash or omit this field.
- Appwrite API key requires broad scopes (`users.*`, `account.*`) because server actions rely on both Admin SDK and Account endpoints.

## Lessons Learned
- Capturing index requirements up front will prevent costly Appwrite queries once manual transactions and exports expand data volume.
