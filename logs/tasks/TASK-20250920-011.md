# TASK-20250920-011 â€” Phase 9 tooling & tests

## Summary
Added smoke tests for CSV/PDF exports, tightened lint scripts, and documented pre-commit recommendations for the secured environment.

## Steps Performed
1. Created TypeScript-aware test harness (`tests/register-ts.js`, `tests/run.js`) and added CSV formatter + PDF generator smoke tests (`tests/csv.test.ts`, `tests/pdf.test.ts`).
2. Updated `package.json` scripts to expose `npm run test` and enforce zero-warning lint runs; surfaced instructions in README/docs.
3. Authored `docs/tooling.md` outlining how to enable lint-staged/Husky in environments where dependency installs are permitted.

## Notes & Issues
- The test harness uses `typescript.transpileModule`; for larger suites consider adopting Vitest/Jest once dependency installs are available.

## Lessons Learned
- A lightweight custom loader keeps tests close to the actual TypeScript sources without introducing heavy tooling.
