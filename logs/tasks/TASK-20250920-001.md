# TASK-20250920-001 â€” Establish core planning artifacts

## Summary
Created `PROJECT_PLAN.md` outlining phased delivery checkpoints and `AGENTS.md` to centralize mission context and logging guidelines.

## Steps Performed
1. Generated phased implementation plan with checklists and legend.
2. Stamped plan with current date for traceability.
3. Authored `AGENTS.md` describing deliverables, log usage, and recorded the initial activity entry.

## Notes & Issues
- Encountered harmless warnings from Homebrew shellenv (`/bin/ps` permission issue) while running shell commands; no impact on results.

## Lessons Learned
- Need structured logging extensions (daily + task-specific) for future transparency (addressed separately in TASK-20250920-002).
