# Daily Log — 2025-09-21

## Completed Tasks
- [TASK-20250921-001](../tasks/TASK-20250921-001.md) — Packaged Next.js standalone build and deployed to Azure App Service (`horizon-banking-uae`).
- [TASK-20250921-002](../tasks/TASK-20250921-002.md) — Rebuilt deployment package to live under `/internet-banking/`, redeployed, and verified subdirectory routing.

## In Progress
- None today.

## Blockers / Risks
- None noted.

## Notes
- Deployment command `./deploy-to-azure.sh` completed successfully before the script timed out while printing Key Vault settings; verified app settings via `az webapp config appsettings list` afterward.
- Manual validation still pending; run checks in `docs/manual-test-plan.md` against the live `/internet-banking/` site.
