# Agent Operations Log & Deliverables Tracker

This file records the purpose of the engagement, key deliverables, and an execution log that should be updated as work progresses. Log every meaningful change with a short rationale so future collaborators understand decisions.

## Mission Overview
- **Project:** Horizon private banking portal transformation
- **Primary Goals:** manual transactions, CSV/PDF exports, restricted access, bank-style theming, Azure deployment guidance, comprehensive documentation
- **Plan Source:** `PROJECT_PLAN.md`

## Deliverables Snapshot
- Running Next.js deployment (Azure App Service recommended) using Appwrite Cloud
- Manual transaction server action + UI workflow
- CSV export endpoint with filters and UI trigger
- PDF statement generator + printable statements page
- Bank-style theme, navigation, transaction badges, legal disclaimer components/pages
- Access control via `ALLOWED_EMAILS` and middleware guard
- Feature flags for Dwolla (transfers) and Plaid integration
- Security enhancements (rate limiting, headers, logging)
- Tests (CSV formatter, PDF route), linting, pre-commit hooks
- Documentation updates (README, Azure deployment guide, theming instructions, change log)

## Operating Guidelines
1. Keep `PROJECT_PLAN.md` in sync with task progress (update checkboxes, add notes).
2. Maintain daily logs under `logs/daily/` summarizing activities; each entry should link to relevant task files.
3. For every task, create/update a per-task log in `logs/tasks/` detailing purpose, steps, issues, and lessons.
4. Record work sessions in the execution log table immediately after completing a task cluster.
5. Reference file paths and commands executed where relevant.
6. Note outstanding risks, blockers, or follow-up items.
7. Sensitive credentials are managed in a secured tenant; ensure any new documentation reflects this and avoid duplicating secrets in commits.

## Outstanding Questions / Risks
- Confirm whether Appwrite Cloud free tier is sufficient for expected traffic; upgrade path may be required.
- Determine if Azure App Service needs VNet integration or private networking (not covered yet).

Update this document alongside the plan so stakeholders have a single source of truth for progress and decisions.
